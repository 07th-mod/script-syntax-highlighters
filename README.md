# For Developers Only:

# How to modify and test
- Open the extension folder (higurashimg/onscripter) in visual studio code (as a whole folder).
- Hit F5 to start debugging. This will open a new vscode instance with the extension loaded.
- Edit the .tmLangauge.json file in the syntax folder
- Make sure vscode regonizes the .tmlLanguage.json file (eg it shows errors and syntax higlighting in the editor) otherwise it's hard to edit
- Remember that trailing commas in arrays are NOT allowed.

# How to export a language VSIX file
- Install npm for your system
- Install vsce: `npm install -g vsce`
- Run `vsce package` while inside the extension folder you want to export

Note that you don't need to properly 'publish' the file to the marketplace, as is described on this page: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/publish-extension

# How to make a new laguage
- Follow the instructions on this page to install and run 'Yo Code': https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/yocode
